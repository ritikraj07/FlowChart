# Flow Chart Project

This project is a web application for creating and managing flow charts. It allows users to visually design flow charts by adding nodes and connecting them with edges. Additionally, users can customize various aspects of the flow chart, such as node colors, edge styles, background settings, and more.

## Features

- **Node Creation**: Users can create nodes representing different elements of a flow chart.
- **Edge Connection**: Nodes can be connected with edges to establish relationships between them.
- **Customization**: Various customization options are available, including node colors, edge styles, and background settings.
- **Save and Load**: Users can save their flow charts and load them later for further editing.
- **Mini Map**: A mini map provides an overview of the entire flow chart for easier navigation.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
- **TypeScript**: The project is implemented using TypeScript, adding static typing and improved tooling support.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The front-end of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Flow**: React Flow is a library used for creating interactive flow charts in React applications.
- **Material-UI**: Material-UI provides pre-designed React components that follow Google's Material Design principles, making it easy to create visually appealing user interfaces.
- **HTML/CSS**: Standard web technologies are used for styling and structuring the application.
- **LocalStorage**: The browser's localStorage is utilized for storing flow chart data locally on the user's device.
